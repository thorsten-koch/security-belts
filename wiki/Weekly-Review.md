The Security Champion Guild organizes a review on a regular basis (e.g., every week/sprint) with one representative of each team working on achieving a Security Belt. If the team does not have a Security Champion yet, then the representative does not have to be a Security Champion.

Everyone presents the progress of their implementation of the Security Belt activity they are currently working on.

This meeting allows teams to get early feedback and to give the Security Champion Guild transparency about the progress the teams are making with their Security Belts.
