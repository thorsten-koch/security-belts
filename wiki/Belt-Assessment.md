There is an assessment for each security belt to ensure that the team has performed the required activities and, thus, has matured concerning software security.

The team has to request the assessment through the guild. Since the Security Belts are intended to empower a team and not only the Security Champion, the whole team has to attend the assessment. The guild organizes the assessors. There should be at least two Security Champions that already achieved the Security Belt that the assessment is about. If there are not enough suitable assessors, the whole guild and additional security experts of the organization attend the assessment and function as assessors.

The assessment consists of all the assessment points described in the belt activities of the respective Security Belt. The team has to present its implementation for each belt activity in the Security Belt they want to achieve. The assessors should also select some activities of previous belts - the team has already achieved - to check if the team is still applying what it has learned.

If the assessment is passed, the belt is awarded to the team by the assessors. Do not forget to celebrate with the team and the guild.
<!-- Optionally, the guild can buy real judo belts and hand them over to the teams. -->
