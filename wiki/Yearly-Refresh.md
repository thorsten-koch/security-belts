Over time, teams are changing: members join and leave and the priority of the teams' work, as well as the security requirements of their product, may vary. Consequently, the guild should regularly check whether the team is still actively applying the activities of a Security Belt.

The Security Champion Guild performs a refresh meeting every year for each team that achieved a Security Belt. At least two members of a team are invited together with two Security Champions (the assessors), which also achieved the belt under assessment. If there are no suitable candidates, proceed in the same manner as during the belt assessment.

In the refresh meeting, all belt activities - from all achieved Security Belts - are tested whether the team is still applying it.
- If all activities are still performed, celebrate this with the team and the guild.
- If some activities are not performed anymore, the team has to revive the activity and assess it again.
- If most of the activities are not performed anymore, the team loses the corresponding Security Belts. It has to execute all failed belt activities again, in order to reassess the lost Security Belts.
